The file is a comma separated file assumed to have four or six fields per line:

    operation, role, user idnumber, course idnumber [, starttime [, endtime]]

where:

* operation - add | del
* role - student | teacher | teacheredit
* user idnumber - idnumber in the user table NB not id
* course idnumber - idnumber in the course table NB not id
* starttime - start time (in seconds since epoch) - optional
* endtime - end time (in seconds since epoch) - optional

It could look something like this:
