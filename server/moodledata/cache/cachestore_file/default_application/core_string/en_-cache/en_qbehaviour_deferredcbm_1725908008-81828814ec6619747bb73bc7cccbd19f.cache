Grades may be as high as 300% if every question is correct with C=3 (high certainty). Misconceptions (confident wrong responses) lower grades much more than wrong responses that are acknowledged to be uncertain. This may even lead to negative overall grades.

**Accuracy** is the % correct ignoring certainty but weighted for the maximum mark of each question. Successfully distinguishing more and less reliable responses gives a better grade than selecting the same certainty for each question. This is reflected in the **CBM Bonus**. **Accuracy** + **CBM Bonus** is a better measure of knowledge than **Accuracy**. Misconceptions can lead to a negative bonus, a warning to look carefully at what is and is not known.";s:14:"cbmgrades_link";s:37:"qbehaviour/deferredcbm/certaintygrade";s:9:"certainty";s:9:"Certainty";s:14:"certainty_help";s:606:"Certainty-based marking requires you to indicate how reliable you think your answer is. The available levels are:

Certainty level     | C=1 (Unsure) | C=2 (Mid) | C=3 (Quite sure)
------------------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------------
Mark if correct     |   1          |    2      |      3
Mark if wrong       |   0          |   -2      |     -6
Probability correct |  <67%        | 67-80%    |    >80%

Best marks are gained by acknowledging uncertainty. For example, if you think there is more than a 1 in 3 chance of being wrong, you should enter C=1 and avoid the risk of a negative mark.
