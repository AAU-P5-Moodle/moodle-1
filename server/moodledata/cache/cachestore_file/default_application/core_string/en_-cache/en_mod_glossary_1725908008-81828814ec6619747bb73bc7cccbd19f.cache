A teacher can allow files to be attached to glossary entries. Attached images are displayed in the entry. Entries can be searched or browsed alphabetically or by category, date or author. Entries can be approved by default or require approval by a teacher before they are viewable by everyone.

If the glossary auto-linking filter is enabled, entries will be automatically linked where the concept words and/or phrases appear within the course.

A teacher can allow comments on entries. Entries can also be rated by teachers or students (peer evaluation). Ratings can be aggregated to form a final grade which is recorded in the gradebook.

Glossaries have many uses, such as

* A collaborative bank of key terms
* A ‘getting to know you’ space where new students add their name and personal details
* A ‘handy tips’ resource of best practice in a practical subject
* A sharing area of useful videos, images or sound files
* A revision resource of facts to remember";s:15:"modulename_link";s:17:"mod/glossary/view";s:16:"modulenameplural";s:10:"Glossaries";s:10:"newentries";s:20:"New glossary entries";s:11:"newglossary";s:12:"New glossary";s:18:"newglossarycreated";s:21:"New glossary created.";s:18:"newglossaryentries";s:21:"New glossary entries:";s:9:"nocomment";s:16:"No comment found";s:10:"nocomments";s:33:"(No comments found on this entry)";s:14:"noconceptfound";s:31:"No concept or definition found.";s:9:"noentries";s:32:"No entries found in this section";s:7:"noentry";s:15:"No entry found.";s:24:"nopermissiontodelcomment";s:41:"You can't delete other people's comments!";s:27:"nopermissiontodelinglossary";s:36:"You can't comments in this glossary!";s:24:"nopermissiontoviewresult";s:49:"You can only look at results for your own entries";s:14:"notcategorised";s:15:"Not categorised";s:11:"notapproved";s:35:"glossary entry is not approved yet.";s:16:"entrynotapproved";s:18:"Entry not approved";s:15:"numberofentries";s:17:"Number of entries";s:9:"onebyline";s:14:"(one per line)";s:19:"page-mod-glossary-x";s:24:"Any glossary module page";s:22:"page-mod-glossary-edit";s:28:"Glossary add/edit entry page";s:22:"page-mod-glossary-view";s:23:"View glossary edit page";s:15:"pendingapproval";s:16:"Pending approval";s:20:"pendingapprovalcount";s:23:"Pending approval ({$a})";s:20:"pluginadministration";s:23:"Glossary administration";s:10:"pluginname";s:8:"Glossary";s:11:"popupformat";s:12:"Popup format";s:5:"print";s:5:"Print";s:15:"printerfriendly";s:24:"Printer-friendly version";s:19:"printviewnotallowed";s:24:"Print view isn't allowed";s:7:"privacy";s:18:"Privacy of results";s:30:"privacy:metadata:core_comments";s:74:"Comments made on glossary definitions are stored using core_comment system";s:27:"privacy:metadata:core_files";s:75:"Files linked to glossary definitions are stored using the core_files system";s:28:"privacy:metadata:core_rating";s:69:"Ratings added to glossary entries are stored using core_rating system";s:25:"privacy:metadata:core_tag";s:68:"Tags added to glossary definitions are stored using core_tag system ";s:33:"privacy:metadata:glossary_entries";s:66:"Information about the user's entries for a given glossary activity";s:44:"privacy:metadata:glossary_entries:attachment";s:42:"The attachment of the entry the user added";s:41:"privacy:metadata:glossary_entries:concept";s:39:"The concept of the entry the user added";s:44:"privacy:metadata:glossary_entries:definition";s:42:"The definition of the entry the user added";s:44:"privacy:metadata:glossary_entries:glossaryid";s:31:"The ID of the glossary activity";s:40:"privacy:metadata:glossary_entries:userid";s:53:"The ID of the user that is adding this glossary entry";s:46:"privacy:metadata:glossary_entries:timemodified";s:73:"The timestamp indicating when the glossary entry was modified by the user";s:8:"question";s:8:"Question";s:15:"rejectedentries";s:16:"Rejected entries";s:12:"rejectionrpt";s:16:"Rejection report";s:21:"removeallglossarytags";s:17:"All glossary tags";s:15:"resetglossaries";s:19:"Delete entries from";s:18:"resetglossariesall";s:27:"Entries from all glossaries";s:11:"rssarticles";s:29:"Number of RSS recent articles";s:16:"rssarticles_help";s:127:"This setting specifies the number of glossary entry concepts to include in the RSS feed.
