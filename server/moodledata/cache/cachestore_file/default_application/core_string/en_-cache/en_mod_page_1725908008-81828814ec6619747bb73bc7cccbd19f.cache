A page can display text, images, sound, video, web links and embedded code, such as Google maps.

Advantages of using the page module rather than the file module include the resource being more accessible (for example to users of mobile devices) and easier to update.

For large amounts of content, it's recommended that a book is used rather than a page.

A page may be used

* To present the terms and conditions of a course or a summary of the course syllabus
* To embed several videos or sound files together with some explanatory text";s:15:"modulename_link";s:13:"mod/page/view";s:16:"modulenameplural";s:5:"Pages";s:13:"optionsheader";s:15:"Display options";s:15:"page-mod-page-x";s:20:"Any page module page";s:16:"page:addinstance";s:23:"Add a new page resource";s:9:"page:view";s:17:"View page content";s:20:"pluginadministration";s:26:"Page module administration";s:10:"pluginname";s:4:"Page";s:11:"popupheight";s:25:"Pop-up height (in pixels)";s:18:"popupheightexplain";s:42:"Specifies default height of popup windows.";s:10:"popupwidth";s:24:"Pop-up width (in pixels)";s:17:"popupwidthexplain";s:41:"Specifies default width of popup windows.";s:10:"printintro";s:24:"Display page description";s:17:"printintroexplain";s:39:"Display page description above content?";s:17:"printlastmodified";s:26:"Display last modified date";s:24:"printlastmodifiedexplain";s:41:"Display last modified date below content?";s:16:"privacy:metadata";s:58:"The Page resource plugin does not store any personal data.";s:15:"search:activity";s:4:"Page";}
