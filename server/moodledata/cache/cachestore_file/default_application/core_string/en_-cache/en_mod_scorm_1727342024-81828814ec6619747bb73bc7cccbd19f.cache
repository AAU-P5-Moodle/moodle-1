Notes on handling of multiple attempts:

* The option to start a new attempt is provided by a checkbox above the Enter button on the content structure page, so be sure you're providing access to that page if you want to allow more than one attempt.
* Some SCORM packages are intelligent about new attempts, many are not. What this means is that if the learner re-enters an existing attempt, if the SCORM content does not have internal logic to avoid overwriting previous attempts they can be overwritten, even though the attempt was 'completed' or 'passed'.
* The settings "Force completed", "Force new attempt" and "Lock after final attempt" also provide further management of multiple attempts.";s:13:"whatgradedesc";s:131:"Whether the highest, average (mean), first or last completed attempt is recorded in the gradebook if multiple attempts are allowed.";s:5:"width";s:5:"Width";s:6:"window";s:6:"Window";s:20:"youmustselectastatus";s:35:"You must select a status to require";s:28:"completionscorerequired_help";s:185:"Enabling this setting will require a user to have at least the minimum score entered to be marked complete in this SCORM activity, as well as any other Activity Completion requirements.";}
