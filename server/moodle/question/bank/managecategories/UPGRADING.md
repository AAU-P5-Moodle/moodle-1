# qbank_managecategories Upgrade notes

## 4.5dev+

### Deprecated

- question_category_list and question_category_list_item are no longer used, and are deprecated. Category lists are now generated by templates.

  For more information see [MDL-72397](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-72397)
- The methods `question_is_only_child_of_top_category_in_context`, `question_is_top_category` and `question_can_delete_cat` from `qbank_managecategories\helper` class have been deprecated and moved to the `\core_question\category_manager` class, minus the misleading `question_` prefix. Following the creation of this class, it does not make sense for them to live inside the `qbank_managecategories` plugin.

  For more information see [MDL-72397](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-72397)
- `qbank_managecategories\question_category_object` is now completely deprecated. Its methods have either been migrated to `qbank_managecategories\question_categories`, `core_question\category_manager`, or are no longer used at all.

  For more information see [MDL-72397](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-72397)

### Changed

- The methods in the `question_category_object` class that are still required following this change have been split between `\qbank_managecategories\question_categories` (for the parts used within this plugin for display a list of categories) and `\core_question\category_manager` (for the parts used for generate CRUD operations on question categories, including outside of this plugin). This will allow `question_category_object` to be deprecated, and avoids other parts of the system wishing to manipulate question categories from having to violate cross-component communication rules.
