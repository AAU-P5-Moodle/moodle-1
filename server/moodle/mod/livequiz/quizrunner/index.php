/**
 * EXPLANATION STUFF FOR HOW ALL THIS IS SET UP
 * ============================================
 *
 * We've made a object-oriented representation of the quiz runner.
 * 
 * At the top is an interface `answer` (`answer/answer.php`), which
 * only has the method `html()`, which makes the answer form. We
 * expect it to contain a submit button that goes to `wait.php`. 
 *
 * We're not quite sure how we want to structure the overall flow of
 * the program, so that's something we need to figure out.
 *
 * Then we have the more specific classes, so `slider` 
 * (`answer/slider.php`), and `multichoice` (`answer/multichoice.php`),
 * whose file also contains the `multichoice_choice` class. For an 
 * example on how to initialise there, see the code in this file.
 *
 * A couldhave to-do is to make an image labelling answer class.
 *
 * Best regards,
 * Team Lennart.
