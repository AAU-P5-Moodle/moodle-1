        Upon upgrading Font Awesome from version 4 to 6, the solid family was
        selected by default. However, FA6 includes additional families such as
        regular and brands. Support for these families has now been integrated,
        allowing icons defined with icon_system::FONTAWESOME to use them.
        Icons can add the FontAwesome family (fa-regular, fa-brands, fa-solid)
        near the icon name to display it using this styling.
