issueNumber: MDL-82567
notes:
  core_table:
    - message: >-
        `core_table\dynamic` declares a new method `::has_capability()` to
        allow classes implementing this interface to perform access checks
        on the dynamic table. This is a breaking change that all dynamic table
        implementations must implement for continued functionality.
      type: changed
