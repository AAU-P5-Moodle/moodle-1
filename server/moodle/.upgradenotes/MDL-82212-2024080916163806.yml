notes:
  core:
    - message: >-
        A new method, get_deprecated_icons(), has been added to the icon_system
        class. All deprecated icons should be registered through this method.
        Plugins can implement a callback to pluginname_get_deprecated_icons() to
        register their deprecated icons too.
        When $CFG->debugpageinfo is enabled, a console message will display a
        list of the deprecated icons.
