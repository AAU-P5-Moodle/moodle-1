  qbank_managecategories:
    - message: >
        `qbank_managecategories\question_category_object` is now completely
        deprecated. Its methods have either been migrated to
        `qbank_managecategories\question_categories`,
        `core_question\category_manager`, or are no longer used at all.
      type: deprecated
  core:
    - message: >
        `moodle_list` and `list_item` were only used by
        `qbank_managecategories`, and these usages have been removed, so
        these classes (and thus all of listlib.php) are now deprecated.
        This method was the only usage of the `QUESTION_PAGE_LENGTH`
        constant, which was defined in `question_category_object.php`,
        and so is also now deprecated.
      type: deprecated
