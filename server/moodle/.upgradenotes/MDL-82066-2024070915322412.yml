        The `get_home_page()` method can now return new constant `HOMEPAGE_URL`,
        applicable when a third-party hook has extended the default homepage
        options for the site


        A new method, `get_default_home_page_url()` has been added which will
        return the correct URL when this constant is returned
      type: changed
