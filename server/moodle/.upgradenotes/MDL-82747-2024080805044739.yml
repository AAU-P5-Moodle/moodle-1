notes:
  core:
    - message: >-
        The Moodle autoloader should now be registered using
        `\core\component::register_autoloader` rather than manually doing so in
        any exceptional location which requires it. It is not normally necessary
        to include the autoloader manually, as it is registered automatically
        when the Moodle environment is bootstrapped.
