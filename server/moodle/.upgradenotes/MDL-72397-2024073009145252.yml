notes:
  qbank_managecategories:
    - message: >
        The methods in the `question_category_object` class that are still
        required following this change have been split between
        `\qbank_managecategories\question_categories` (for the parts used within
        this plugin for display a list of categories) and
        `\core_question\category_manager` (for the parts used for generate CRUD
        operations on question categories, including outside of this plugin).
        This will allow `question_category_object` to be deprecated, and avoids
        other parts of the system wishing to manipulate question categories from
        having to violate cross-component communication rules.
      type: changed
    - message: >
        The methods `question_is_only_child_of_top_category_in_context`,
        `question_is_top_category` and `question_can_delete_cat` from
        `qbank_managecategories\helper` class have been deprecated and moved to
        the `\core_question\category_manager` class, minus the misleading
        `question_` prefix. Following the creation of this class, it does not
        make sense for them to live inside the `qbank_managecategories` plugin.
      type: deprecated
