issueNumber: MDL-81523
notes:
  core:
    - message: >
        All the setup and tear down methods of `PHPUnit` now are required to,
        always, call to their parent counterparts. This is a good practice to
        avoid future problems, especially when updating to PHPUnit >= 10.

        This includes the following methods:
          - `setUp()`
          - `tearDown()`
          - `setUpBeforeClass()`
          - `tearDownAfterClass()`
      type: fixed
