issueNumber: MDL-80741
notes:
  mod_assign:
    - message: >
        The default option "Never" for `attemptreopenmethod` setting, which
        disallowed multiple attempts at the assignment, has been removed. This
        option was unnecessary because limiting attempts to 1 through the
        `maxattempts` setting achieves the same behavior.
      type: removed
    - message: >
        The constant `ASSIGN_ATTEMPT_REOPEN_METHOD_NONE` has been deprecated,
        and a new default value for `attemptreopenmethod` has been set to
        "Automatically until pass".
      type: deprecated
    - message: >
        A new default value for `attemptreopenmethod` has been set to
        "Automatically until pass".
      type: improved
