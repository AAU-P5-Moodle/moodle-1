  core:
    - message: |
        Two new functions have been introduced in the \moodle_database class:
        - `get_counted_records_sql()`
        - `get_counted_recordset_sql()`
        These methods are compatible with all databases.
        They will check the current running database engine and apply the COUNT window function if it is supported,
        otherwise, they will use the usual COUNT function.

        The COUNT window function optimization is applied to the following databases:
        - PostgreSQL
        - MariaDB
        - Oracle
        MySQL and SQL Server do not use this optimization due to insignificant performance differences before and
        after the improvement.
      type: improved
