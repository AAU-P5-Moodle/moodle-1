  core_course:
    - message: >+
        The reset course page has been improved. The words "Delete" and "Remove" have been removed from all the options to make it easier to focus on the data to be removed and avoid inconsistencies and duplicated information.
        Third party plugins implementing reset methods might need to:

        - Add static element in the _reset_course_form_definition method before all the options with the Delete string:
            `$mform->addElement('static', 'assigndelete', get_string('delete'));`
        - Review all the strings used in the reset page to remove the "Delete" or "Remove" words from them.
