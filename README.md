# LiveQuiz

LiveQuiz is a Moodle module that aims to facilitate interactive quizzes for both live classroom use and self-study, while offering a more active practice and learning to students.

This project is developed by students at Aalborg University, as a semester project for the BSc in Software Engineering.
The project was initiated in 2024, and currently supports creating, editing, and taking quizzes in practice mode. Initial work on the live quiz functionality has been done in the [Websocket branch](https://github.com/AAU-P5-Moodle/moodle-1/tree/websockets-branch).

Development is ongoing and processes on a semester-by-semester basis.
